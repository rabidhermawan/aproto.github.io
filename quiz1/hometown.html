                    Surabaya has been the chief trading centre of eastern Java since the 14th century. It was controlled by the Dutch from the mid-18th through the mid-20th century, except for a brief period under the British in the early 19th century. During World War II Surabaya was occupied by Japan (1942–45) and heavily bombed by the Allies. In November 1945 a fierce battle was fought in Surabaya between Indonesian nationalists and British troops who were attempting to assert Allied control, which was interpreted by the nationalists to mean a prelude to the return of the Dutch. The city was damaged again during Indonesia’s war for independence (1945–49) from the Netherlands.
